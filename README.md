This is my case study capstone project I did for the completion of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate (via Coursera)

Cyclistic-Divvy-Bikes Google Analytics Capstone Project using Cyclistic (Divvy) bike rider data

Objective (Ask Phase): To analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to determine the best marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Prepare Phase: The data and source I used in my case study was downloaded directly from the Divvy Bikes' website: https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data

All the data files were organized by month, and I used 12-months (one year) as my time period for the study. I ascertained this to be a trustworthly source because it was aggregated and posted by Divvy Bikes themselves online. I did notice some outliers and aberations within the data - these are brought up in my Case Study 1.pptx file.

Process Phase: I used Microsoft Excel spreadsheets intially to familiarize myself with the all the data to better understand it before I began cleaning, formatting, sorting, filtering and ultimately combining the data togeather for analysis. My first task was to review the values present for out of the ordinary figures. I also took this oppurtunity to add multiple new columns in each of the Excel files such as 'Month name', Time of day', 'Trip duration', and 'Day of the week' for use in my analysis section. Data that I wasn't fully confident in or didn't completely understand was marked/noted and excluded from the analysis phase.

Analysis Phase: Here I used Google's BigQuery tool and various SQL queries to try and discover and further understand trends in the data that were then represented in the data visualisations I created

Share Phase: Using Tableau, I made multiple visualizations to represent the data my analysis covered. The link to my published Tableau visuals can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matt6027/viz/GoogleDataAnalyticsCaseStudy_16549786533620/9_AverageTripDurationBetweenClassicandElectricBikes_1

Act Phase: I created a Microsoft Powerpoint presentation - Case Study 1.pptx. with a full breakdown of the study including reccomendations for action and next steps that could be taken by stakeholders and senior management.
